var model=[{img:"img/paranormal1.jpg",title:'PARANORMAL #1<br>(oil on plastic artists\' board 8"x10")',desc:"I call this technique \"paranormal\" for that word best fits what's going on here. I discovered this phenomena when I mixed black paint to the consistency of ink to see how fine a line I could produce using a pallet knife. Before the tip of the knife could touch the surface of the 8\"X10\" plastic artists' board, the paint went flying off in all directions, defying gravity and, at the same time creating what appeared to be a head. Because I had cleaned the surface with a wool sock, I assumed static electricity must have something to do with it. Curious, I repeated the process with even more astounding results, showing trees, animals, faces within faces and any number of easily recognized objects, containing lines finer than I had ever seen before, much finer than I am capable of, using any other method. I am not a believer in paranormal things such as s√©ances, ghosts and whatever, so why should this happen to me? I'll be including many more of these pictures, much more explicit than the one above, and I'll be posting a video so you can see for yourself what it looks like when it's occurring.

You have to set up and paint quickly if you have others waiting in the car. Luckily, most of my others are beer-drinking males, who don't mind taking a break from driving. I've come to call this style, which seems to be between semi realism and semi impressionism, \"Skelism\" since I appear to be the only one doing it a lot.",id:14},{img:"img/chinwag1.jpg",title:'CHINWAG #1<br>(oil on artists\' plastic board 8"X10")',desc:"I thought it might be fun to do a series on this theme, but only created 6 or 7 then went on to something else.",id:13},{img:"img/DSC00088.JPG",title:"ALIEN APE WITH WOMAN IN EAR",desc:"This was the first picture from an experiment using palette knife only.
