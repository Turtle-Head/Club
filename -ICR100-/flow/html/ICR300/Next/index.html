      Exercise 1:
        The user inputs two numbers
        The program will print and sum all the even numbers between the user’s input.
        Input = 1, 9
        Output = 2, 4, 6, 8 (this could be in the console) “The sum of all the even numbers is 20”


        Exercise 2:
        Make a loop that finds the highest number from a set of user inputs
        Input = 1,5,6,8,9,55,10,9
        Output =  55
